description: "Work skill. An element of this node comes to you: it asks how the node works — the wake text «Element <id> asks about the node's architecture: «…»» — or it tells the architect something, an alarm of its clock first of all — «Element <id> tells the architect: «…»». A question: find the answer in the core's instruction by its words, read only that section, answer in at most 10 lines with npm run task -- <id> \"Answer from the core to «<question>»: …\" (the only case where you read a file of the core). A message: pass the element's words to the person where they read you now, naming the element."

# Answer an element — its question or its message for the architect

**Process: working** — nothing changes in git: you read one section and answer, or you pass words on.

A hint, not a law: models of late 2026 work worse under rigid step-by-step instructions.

## A question about the node

1. Two to four English words of the question (the core's instruction is English):
   `grep -n -i "<word>" ../../CLAUDE.md | head -20` — the line numbers show the section.
2. Read only that section: `sed -n '<from>,<to>p' ../../CLAUDE.md` — tens of lines, the file is about 24 thousand
   characters, eight sections: role, context, building blocks, scenarios, modes, laws, glossary, where the details are.
3. Answer in at most 10 plain lines — what the node does and which door or command the element uses:
   `npm run task -- <id> "Answer from the core to «<the question>»: …"` — the question goes in: the answer may reach a fresh
   session that never asked. Only what you read; a path or a door you did not see is not named.
4. Nothing found → `npm run task -- <id> "Answer from the core to «<the question>»: the core's instruction does not say …; ask your architect."`

## A message for the architect (`tell-core`)

The element's agent says «Element <id> tells the architect: «…»» — work its clock woke it for ended with words the person must hear
(node step 636). A plain reminder never comes here: it surfaces in the main chat by itself through the core's notice door (636-8).

1. `npm run person` — where the architect reads you now (woken by an element, this session has no chat of its own: send with the reply
   tool to the chat_id it names); write there in the person's language — the element's words translated if they came in another,
   nothing else changed — as a working-process event: `⚙️ *Рабочий процесс · <the element's name>*`, the words a quote.
   **How it looks in Telegram** (the owner, 2026-11-03: «Цитата + значок + шапка (Рекомендую)»): the reply tool with `format:
   "markdownv2"` — the first line is the mark and the header in bold, the words a quote, one `>` per line. In the text put a backslash before each of
    _ * [ ] ( ) ~ > # + - = | { } . ! and the backquote; a send refused for its entities goes again as plain text.
2. Nothing added: no plan, no offer, no work. The person answers about it («перенеси на завтра») — the answer goes back to the element:
   `npm run task -- <id> "<their words>"`.
3. The person cannot be reached (no channel) — say so to the element: `npm run task -- <id> "Answer from the core to «…»: not delivered — …"`.

## Both

Never `.env.local`, never an element's files, never a change. Then `npm run done -- --close` when the element woke you; inside a live
conversation with the person — go on with it.
